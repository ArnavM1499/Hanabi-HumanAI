# Intro

This repo is building off of the code from https://github.com/yawgmoth/pyhanabi for my master's research on Human-AI Collaboration

## Our approach

Creating strategies to learn to collaborate with. If our agent can learn how to recognize the other player's strategy and then utilize structured knowledge of how to best coordinate with that strategy, we hypothesize that the Human-AI team can gain high rewards.
